# Hungry Snake

The Hungry Snake Game has been created on the Defold game engine using the Lua programming language. It's a version of the original classic Snake with a few fun twists.

Rules: Eat all the colored tiles on the board to win! Avoid the red skulls and don't eat your own tail. These actions and leaving the game board will all result in a game over.

Controls: Use the up, down, left and right arrow keys to control the snake.

Powerup Key:
1.	Red Skull: Eating results in a game over.
2.	Mushroom: Shortens snake length.
3.	Star: Bonus points!

There are a total of 15 levels in the game to complete. H
